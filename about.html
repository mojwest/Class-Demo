                About
            </h1>
            <p class="about-me">Coding is an exciting field that I am eager to join and become a part of. So much of the
                world uses
                different forms of technology and it's only growing by the day. In many cases coding is the backbone and
                foundation of how all this technology works. This makes it a very appealing skill to have and industry
                to join. <br>Coding also works one's mind in a very challenging yet fun way. It's rewarding to see what
                you've build and how it operates. <br>Virtually every industry these days needs coders in some form or
                another so it seems like an excellent career decision.</p>
            <p class="about-me">I grew up in New York and New Jersey and studied mathematics at Yeshiva University in
                New York City. I
                worked as an actuary for about four years in property and casualty actuarial consulting. I've also
                worked as a production assistant for a freelance videographer in New York.</p>
            <p class="about-me">Additionally, I enjoy traveling, hiking, and playing ice hockey. Hiking is a crucial
                part of my travels.
                I love the outdoors and mountains in particular. Meeting and connecting with people from all around the
                world is another highlight of mine when traveling. I've always enjoyed sports and hockey has always been
                my favorite. The speed of the game, the skating, the finesse, the teamwork, the thrill of scoring goals,
                etc. Too bad there's not much hockey in Israel.</p>
            <p class="about-me">
                I was born in New York City and lived in the Washington Heights neighborhood of NYC until I was eight
                years old. Then I moved to the suburbs in Teaneck, NJ where I spent the rest of my childhood. After high
                school I spent a year and a half studying in Israel in Alon Shvut. Then I went off to college back in
                Washington Heights. I lived in multiple places in New York City, most recently in Bedford Stuyvesent,
                Brooklyn. Now I've been living in Jerusalem for about six months.
